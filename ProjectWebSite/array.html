Assignment 3.2 #2
Write and test JavaScript scripts for the two exercises that follow, debug (if necessary).
 When required to write a function, you must include a script to test the function with at least two different data sets.
  In all cases, for testing, you must write an HTML file that references the JavaScript file.
  Create a function titled counter that takes an array of numbers as the parameter.
  The function is then to return an array holding the numbers of negative elements, zeros, and values greater than zero
   in the given array parameter.
